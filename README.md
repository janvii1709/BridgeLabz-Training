17 Dec 2025(Wednesday) :

⦁	Solved 5 random problems and pushed them in the leetcode practice folder in my GitHub repository.

⦁	Implemented the Git commands learned previous day by merging the local folder with remote folder and by creating gcr-codebase branch in the repository.

⦁	Also solved some more basic problems and pushed them in the programming-elements folder of gcr-codebase in my GitHub repository.


18 Dec 2025(Thursday) :

⦁	Revised basic programming concepts and solved the problems for the making the concept more clear.

⦁	Worked on variables, constants, datatypes , naming convention and as well as commenting in the code to make it more clear.

⦁	Practiced basic logical problems of LEVEL 1 and LEVEL 2 and pushed them in the programming-elements folder of gcr-codebase in my GitHub repository.


19 Dec 2025(Friday) :

⦁	Revised Java Fundamentals, Conditional statements and Loops concepts and implemented them in various problems to make the concept more clear.

⦁	Practiced conditional statements, for and while loop by solving LEVEL 1, LEVEL 2 and LEVEL 3 questions and pushed them in the control-flows folder in my GitHub repository.

⦁	Learned about the naming convention and implemented it by making changes in the code and pushing them again on the GitHub.


20 Dec 2025 (Saturday) :
