17 Dec 2025(Wednesday) :

⦁	Solved 5 random problems and pushed them in the leetcode practice folder in my GitHub repository.

⦁	Implemented the Git commands learned previous day by merging the local folder with remote folder and by creating gcr-codebase branch in the repository.

⦁	Also solved some more basic problems and pushed them in the programming-elements folder of gcr-codebase in my GitHub repository.



18 Dec 2025(Thursday) :

⦁	Revised basic programming concepts and solved the problems for the making the concept more clear.

⦁	Worked on variables, constants, datatypes , naming convention and as well as commenting in the code to make it more clear.

⦁	Practiced basic logical problems of LEVEL 1 and LEVEL 2 and pushed them in the programming-elements folder of gcr-codebase in my GitHub repository.



19 Dec 2025(Friday) :

⦁	Revised Java Fundamentals, Conditional statements and Loops concepts and implemented them in various problems to make the concept more clear.

⦁	Practiced conditional statements, for and while loop by solving LEVEL 1, LEVEL 2 and LEVEL 3 questions and pushed them in the control-flows folder in my GitHub repository.

⦁	Learned about the naming convention and implemented it by making changes in the code and pushing them again on the GitHub.



20 Dec 2025 (Saturday) :

⦁ Practiced Java Arrays concepts including one-dimensional and multi-dimensional arrays.

⦁ Learned how to create, access, and modify arrays using loops and the length property.

⦁ Solved multiple array-based problems.

⦁ Implemented 2D arrays for storing and processing data

⦁ Pushed all completed problems and practice exercises to the core-java-practice branch in the gcr-codebase folder on GitHub.

⦁ Implemented real-world Java programs like Coffee Billing System and BMI Calculator using basic input, operators, loops, and      conditional statements.

⦁ Focused on clean code practices, proper naming conventions, and control flow using switch, if-else, and loops.



WEEK 2



22 Dec 2025 (Monday) :


⦁ Learned and revised Java String concepts required for String Lab practices.

⦁ Understood what Strings are in Java and different ways to create Strings using literals and new keyword.

⦁ Practiced the use of escape sequences like \n, \t, \", \\ to format output properly.

⦁ Learned how to take String input from the user using Scanner class (next() and nextLine()).

⦁ Worked with String arrays and learned how to store and access multiple strings using loops.

⦁ Implemented Strings as method parameters to understand how data is passed between methods.

⦁ Practiced commonly used String class built-in methods such as: length() , charAt() , equals() , toUpperCase() , toLowerCase() ,substring().

⦁ Pushed all completed problems and practice exercises to the core-java-practice branch in the gcr-codebase folder on GitHub.



23 Dec 2025 (Tuesday) :


⦁ Reviewed the supporting study material explained during the sessions to strengthen conceptual understanding.

⦁ Learned techniques to track daily tasks, monitor progress, and improve overall productivity.

⦁ Implemented scenario-based Java programs such as "Election Booth Manager" and "Metro Smart Card Fare Deduction" using conditions, loops, and operators.

⦁ Practiced "Java String programs" covering string creation, input handling, and common string operations.

⦁ Gained basic understanding of "SDLC" phases and their role in software development.

24 Dec 2025 (Wednesday) :


⦁ Studied and implemented Java Methods concepts including user-defined methods, static methods, recursive methods, and reuse of methods.

⦁ Practiced making methods dynamic by passing inputs and returning results effectively.

⦁ Used Java Standard Library methods and the 'java.lang.Math' class in problem-solving.

⦁ Followed best programming practices by using variables for all inputs, fixed values, and results.

⦁ Applied proper naming conventions for classes, methods, and variables to maintain clean and readable code.

⦁ Learned structured coding by writing meaningful method names that clearly indicate the action and output.

⦁ Pushed all completed problems and practice exercises to the core-java-practice branch in the gcr-codebase folder on GitHub.



26 Dec 2025 (Friday) :
